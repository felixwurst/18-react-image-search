# Project: React Image Search

### Description:

An image search is implemented in React with integration of the pixabay-API. The number of hits can be further limited by choosing different search filters. The image type, orientation, category, minimum width, minimum height, colour and the sorting of the images can be selected. Furthermore, the language of the image descriptions can be changed from English to German. The reloading of the images is done by a so-called 'lazy loading', i.e. if the bottom of the image selection is reached while scrolling, new images are reloaded until all existing images are displayed.

### Tools:

-   HTML
-   JavaScript
-   Bootstrap
-   React
